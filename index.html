          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="faq-text">
              We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other
              search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled about you using
              your personal information like search, browsing, and purchase
              history. Since we don’t collect that information, search ads on
              DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you are viewing,
              not on you as a person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll
              show you ads about cars. Learn more.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="faq-text">
              Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default,
              their trackers have been found on 75% of the top million websites,
              which means they are tracking most everywhere you go on the
              Internet (unless you stop them with DuckDuckGo!). And that’s just
              the tip of the iceberg. Learn more.

            Why use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="faq-text">
              Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part
              because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers on millions
              of websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t track
              your searches and our DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app
              block Google’s (and many other companies’) trackers across the
              Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as
              it should be. And that’s just the beginning — by using DuckDuckGo
              you also escape the manipulation of the filter bubble and can use
              the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled).

              DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without
              tradeoffs in result quality. We have everything you’ve come to
              expect in an online search experience, and a few bonus features
              that make searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit
              more fun! And, on top of that, because there is no search history
              on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble of manipulated
              results. Learn more.

            What’s the difference between using DuckDuckGo and Incognito mode?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="faq-text">
              It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called
              “Incognito” mode. In fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes
              information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from
              saving your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service
              providers, or governments from being able to track you across the
              Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous
              and if you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you
              private when browsing off of search results. Learn more.
